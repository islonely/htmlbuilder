# v-htmlbuilder
 An extension on strings.Builder targeted for HTML development

## Installation
VPM - No, that's not a typo. VPM only allows package names of 10 character. Which means I couldn't finish the word 'builder'.
```bash
v install islonely.htmlbuilde
```
VPKG
```bash
vpkg get htmlbuilder
```
Git
```bash
git clone https://github.com/islonely/v-htmlbuilder
```
